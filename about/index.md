# Matheus Barbieri



Born and currently living in Brazil, I'm a programmer who started his jorney in 2007 learning how to create tibia server(an old fashioned MMORPG), in the middle of this entire time i have done a bunch of stuffs as a side hustle wile i was studying, like: beeing a web designer, DJ, a bartender, and programming. at the time i was a web master, using more flash than i should, saw the rise of HTML5 and the fall of a lot of thecnoologies like, ASP, FTP, xampp (sorry about that, i always lost the point with the nostalgia), and in 2018 i decided to start to work as a professional software engineer after finished the college.
