Having a proper control of this issue always be a big mess, mostly because this easily become a safety issue most of the time in companies i have passed, someone have all the secrets stored in their machine or in some dark and scared place, or all of the secrets start to be stored in one private repository where every one in a point of the time will have the access or other horrible solution like that.</description></item></channel></rss>
